    <h2 class="mainheading" id="top"> These social activities are easy to find in Ginnheim</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As I show you on the food page, there <a href="food.html">are many restaurants</a> around in oldtown Ginnheim - so to not gain to much weight I would always recommend you go for a walk afterwards <a href="niddapark.html">in the Niddapark.</a>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>German atheltic teams are a very unique approach of combining social activity, community and sports. Especially because German Universities do not compete in the most sports. Close to the park you can find two athletic teams "Blau-Gelb" and "Germania Ginnheim" ( my first soccer team was Blau-Gelb so I am kind of biased). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>And for those who want to do community work in Ginnheim there are also a lot of options. One small example is the open library at the "Kirchplatz". All over the city you find those open book trading storages - most of them are old public telephones. In the big picture there is nebenan.de, a webpage to help out people from your community - and Ginnheim has a lot of members. So, become part of the community and you become a part of Ginnheim...&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
